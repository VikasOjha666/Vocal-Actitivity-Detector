# Vocal-Actitivity-Detector.
### This is a voice activity detector based on CNN LSTM model which detects the vocal activity on a audio length of 1s.I used it for detecting the speech on large audio track and extracting the speech containing segments from that track.
### This model was trained on a massive dataset of 35GB which I created from many audio tracks so it was not feasible to upload that.
### The model obtained a accuracy of 94% when tested in real application.(More than at training time).

## To test the model type `python Test.py (name_of_file)`

# Requirements.
#### Python 3
#### Numpy,matplotlib
#### Keras.
#### Librosa.
